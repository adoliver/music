It's be\[E&]ginning to look a \[A&]lot like \[E&]Christmas,

It's \[E&]beginning to look a \[A&]lot like \[E&]Christmas,

on your \[Fm]own \[B&7]front \[E&]door.

It's be^ginning to look a ^lot like ^Christmas,
every^where you ^go ^
There's a ^tree in the Grand Ho^tel,
^one in the park as ^well,
the ^sturdy kind that ^doesn't mind the ^snow ^ 
\endverse

\beginverse*\replay[lookverseB]
It's be^ginning to look a ^lot like ^Christmas,
soon the ^bells will ^start ^ 
And the ^thing that will make them ^ring,
is the ^carol that you ^sing,
right with^in ^your ^heart
