\musicnote{Fast, upbeat}
\[G]Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
Had a very shiny \[D]nose
\[D]And if you ever saw it
You would even say it \[G]glows \echo{Like a lightbulb!}

\[G]All of the other reindeer 
Used to laugh and call him \[D]names \echo{Like Pinnochio!}

Join in any reindeer \[G]games \echo{Like Monopoly!}

As they shouted out with \[D]glee \echo{Yipee!}

You'll go down in \[G]history \echo{Like Columbus!}
