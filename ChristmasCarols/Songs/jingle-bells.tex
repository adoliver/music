\beginverse
\[G]Dashing thorugh the snow, in a one-horse open \[C]sleigh.
\[Am]O'er the fields we \[D7]go, laughing all the \[G]way.
\[G]Bells on bob-tails ring, making spirits \[C]bright.
What \[Am]fun it is to \[D]ride and sing a \[D7]sleighing song \[G]tonight. \[D7]Oh!
\endverse

\beginchorus
(Play Bells)
\[G]Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle \[C]all the \[G]way!
\[C]Oh what fun it \[G]is to ride
In a \[A7]one-horse open \[D7]sleigh, hey!
\[G]Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle \[C]all the \[G]way!
\[C]Oh what fun it \[G]is to ride
In a \[D7]one-horse open \[G]sleigh, hey!
\endchorus

\beginverse
^Day or two ago, I thought I'd take a ^ride
And ^soon Miss Fanny ^Bright was seated by my ^side
The ^horse was lean and lank, misfortune seemed his ^lot
He ^ran into a ^drifted bank, and ^we, we got ^upsot.  Oh!
\endverse

\beginverse
^Now the ground is white; Go it while you're ^young!
^Take the girls ^tonight, And sing this sleighing ^song.
^Just get a bobtail'd nag; Two-forty for his  ^speed.
Then ^hitch him to an ^open sleigh, and ^crack! You'll take ^the lead! ^Oh!
\endverse
