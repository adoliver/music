\[Am]We three kings of \[E]Orient \[Am]are; \[Am]bearing gifts we \[E]traverse a\[Am]far
\[C]field and \[G/B]fountain, \[Am]moor and \[F]mountain, \[Dm]following \[E]yonder \[Am]star.
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[G]O-oh \[C]star of wonder, \[F]star of \[C]light, star with royal \[F]beauty \[C]bright,
\[Am]Westward \[G]leading, \[F]still pro\[G]ceeding, \[C]guide us to thy \[F]perfect \[C]light.
\endchorus

\beginverse
^Born a king on ^Bethlehem's ^plain ^gold I bring to ^crown Him ^again,
^King for^ever, ^ceasing ^never, ^over us ^all to ^reign.
\endverse

\beginverse
^Frankincense to ^offer have ^I; ^incense owns a ^diety ^nigh;
^Prayer and ^praising, ^voices ^raising, ^worshipping ^god on ^high.
\endverse

\beginverse
^Myrrh ismine; its ^bitter per^fume, ^breathes a life of ^gathering ^gloom;
^sorrowing ^sighing, ^bleeding, ^dying, ^sealed in the ^stone-cold ^tomb.
\endverse

\beginverse
^Glorious now be^hold Him ^arise; ^King and God and ^sacri^fice,
^Al-le-^lu-ia, ^Al-le-^lu-ia ^sounds through the ^earth and ^skies.
\endverse
