\beginverse
^When the clock is ^striking twelve, ^when I'm fast ^asleep;
^Down the chimney ^broad and black, ^with your pack you'll ^creep.
^All the stockings ^you will find, ^hanging in a ^row.
^Mine will be the ^shortest one, ^you'll be sure to ^know.
\endverse

\beginverse
^Johnny want a ^pair of skates, ^Susy want a ^sled,
^Nellies wants a ^picture book; ^yellow, blue and ^red.
^Now I think I'll ^leave to you, ^what to give the ^rest.
^Choose for me, dear ^Santa Claus, ^you will know the ^best.
\endverse
