\beginverse
\[G]Good King Wence\[Em]slas looked out \[C]on the Feat of \[G]Stephen.
\[G]When the snow lay \[Em]round about \[C]deep and crisp and \[G]even.
\[G]Brightly shone the \[Em]moon that night \[C]though the frost was \[G]cruel.
\[G]when a poor man \[Em]came in sight \[C]gathering winter \[G]fu-\[Cadd9]u-\[G]el

\beginverse
^''Hither, page, and ^stand by me, ^if thou know'st it; ^telling,
^Yonder peasant, ^who is he? ^Where and what his ^dwelling?''
^''Sire, he lives a ^good league hence, ^underneath the ^mountain;
^Right against the ^forest fence, ^by Saint Agnes' ^fou - ^oun - ^tain.''
\endverse

\beginverse
^''Bring me flesh, and ^bring me wine, ^Bring me pine logs ^hither;
^Thou and I will ^see him dine, ^When we bear them ^thither.''
^Page and monarch ^forth they went, ^Forth they went to^gether;
^Through the rude winds ^wild lament, ^And the bitter ^wea - ^eh - ^ther
\endverse

\beginverse
^''Sire, the night is ^darker now, ^And the wind blows ^stronger;
^Fails my heart, I ^know not how, ^I can go no ^longer.''
^''Mark my footsteps, ^my good page, ^Tread thou in them ^bodly;
^Thou shalt find the ^winter's rage ^Freeze thy blood less ^co - ^old -^ly.''
\endverse

\beginverse
^In his master's ^steps he trod, ^Where the snow lay ^dinted;
^Heat was in the ^very sod ^Which the saint had ^printed.
^Therefore, Christian ^men, be sure, ^Wealth or rank pos - ^sess - ing,
^Ye who now will ^bless the poor, ^Shall yourselves find ^ble - ^ess - ^ing.
