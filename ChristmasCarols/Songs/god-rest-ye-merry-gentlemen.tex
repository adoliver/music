\beginverse
God \[Em]rest ye merry, gentlemen, Let \[C]nothing you dis\[B7]may,
Re\[Em]member, Christ, our Sa - vior, Was \[C]born on Christmas \[B7]day;
To \[Am]save us all from \[G]Satan's pow'r, When \[Em]we were gone a\[D]stray.
\endverse

\beginchorus
O \[G]tidings of \[B7]comfort and \[Em]joy, comfort and \[D]joy,
O \[G]tidings of \[B7]comfort and \[Em]joy.
\endchorus

\beginverse
In ^Bethlehem, in Is-ra-el, This ^blessed Babe was ^born,
And ^laid within a man - ger up^on this blessed ^morn;
The ^which His mother ^Ma - ry did ^nothing take in ^scorn.
\endverse

\beginverse
From ^God, our heav'nly Fa - ther, A ^blessed angel ^came,
And ^unto certain shep - herds brought ^tidings of the ^same;
How ^that in Beth-le-^hem was born The ^Son of God by ^name.
\endverse

\beginverse
The ^shephers at those ti - dings, Re-^joic-ed much in ^mind,
And ^left their flock a-feed-ing, In ^tempest, storm and ^wind,
And ^went to Beth-le-^hem strait-way, The ^Son of God to ^find.
\endverse
