\beginverse
City \[C]sidewalk, busy sidewalk
Dressed in \[F]Holiday style.
In the \[G]air there's a feeling of \[C]Christmas.
Children \[C]laughing, people passing
Meeting \[F]smile after smile.
And on \[G]every street corner you \[C]hear.
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[C]Silver bells, \[F]silver bells.
\[G]It's Christmas-time in the \[C]city.
\[C]Ring-a-ling, \[F]hear them ring.
\[G]Soon it will be Christmas \[C]day.
\endchorus

\beginverse
Strings of ^street lights, even stop lights
Blink a ^bright red and green.
As the ^shoppers run home with their ^treasures.
Hear the ^snow crunch, see the kids bunch,
This is ^Santa's big scene.
And a^bove all the bustle you ^hear...
